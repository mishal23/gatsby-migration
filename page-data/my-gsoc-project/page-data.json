Bake was developed to simplify the assembly of these pieces of software in a coherent and useful way. It is a tool for coordinated software building from multiple repositories, developed for the ns-3 project.</p>\n<h3>Existing Features in Bake</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatic handling of dependencies</li>\n<li>Automatic download of the required sources</li>\n<li>Automatic correct build of the required modules</li>\n<li>Off-line installation and build capabilities</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>GSoC Project</h2>\n<p>ns-3 has certain modules into it's core and quite of them are also made by researchers/developers, however to reduce the size of the core not all modules are merged into the mainline of the ns-3 and are maintained seperately with the flexibilty to use them by downloading the module in the <code class=\"language-text\">contrib/</code> directory of the ns-3. The AppStore maintains the modules developed by the researchers/developers. Although the ns-3-AppStore and the Bake build system exists, both of them function independently. If the AppStore and the Bake build system start interacting with each other, it would make it easier for the developers to install the new modules. That's the project goal! Make it easier for the ns-developers to install new modules. While install of a module is done other features such as update the module, search for a module, fetch the module configuration file also will be supported. For that the AppStore will be needed to send necessary configuration file and other details through REST APIs and then add command line features to bake which would eventually download the module repo, install the necessary dependencies and finally build the source tree.</p>\n<p>Since the ns-3-AppStore uses Python2.7 and Django 1.8, one of the tasks will also be to upgrade it to the latest versions to keep up with the technology and also since Python2.7 support is going to end by January, 2020. Some additional features to the ns-3-AppStore such as multi-threaded comments and download statistics for the modules are also planned.</p>\n<h2>Community Bonding Period</h2>\n<p>The community bonding period has ended and it mainly focused on setting up development environment and understanding the code base of the Bake build system, testing and understanding the existing functionalities, and the work flow. My mentor also suggested me to research about the various cases and build a strong plan, so that the coding period stays smooth. I also started documenting the ns-3-AppStore: user-workflow and the user-guide, which helped me better understand the exisiting functionalities of the AppStore.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My GSoC Project","date":"May 28, 2019","description":"A brief into the project, the organization and the gains out of the community bonding period.","keywords":"mishal23, gsoc, gsoc2019, project, ns-3, ns-3-AppStore, bake, open-source, tcp-nv"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/my-gsoc-project"}}}
